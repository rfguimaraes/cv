                \item[\href{https://gitlab.com/rfguimaraes/owl-change}{OWL2DL-Change: Modularisation}:] Implementation of Belief Change algorithms over OWL 2 DL ontologies using OWL. The code is instrumented with JMH for measuring the impact of ontology modularisation on computational performance.
                \item[\href{https://gitlab.com/rfguimaraes/owl2dl-ccc}{OWL2DL-CCC}:] Uses OWL API to create ontology datasets by modifying OWL ontologies according to specification given as JSON. Creates test cases for non-standard reasoning tasks.
     FileCopy   \item[\href{https://github.com/rfguimaraes/DataScienceCapstone}{IBM Data Science Specialization Capstone Project}:] Developed as task for attaining the certification. Employs a wide range of skills and tools in Data Science (Pandas, SQL, Dash, Scikit-learn) to investigate the recovery rate of stage 1 rockets in SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches.
